The maps illustrate Islip’s current layout and its development plan.

Overall, the plan makes the city more commercial and residential, and its transportation routes will become significantly more accessible. Most of the changes are projected to take place in the central area of the town.

In the center’s northern half, the shopping lane will be reconstructed to provide a bus station, shopping center, and car park, as well as new residential units from west to east. The units are set to be connected via a small road to a dual carriageway. The dual carriageway is planned to entirely encircle the town center, while the original main road to the south of these shops is projected to be removed and substituted with a pedestrian-only street.

As for the center’s southern part, the lane of shops adjacent to the south side of the main road will be expanded noticeably. The park to the shops’ southwest will be reduced in size remarkably to make way for housing redevelopment in this section. In addition to the striking transformation within the town center, the school to its southwest is set to expand and connect to the dual carriageway, whereas the houses to the town’s southern side will remain unchanged.
