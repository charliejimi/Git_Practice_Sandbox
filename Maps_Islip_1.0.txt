The maps illustrate Islipâ€™s current layout and its development plan.

Overall, the plan makes the city more commercial and residential, and its transportation routes will become significantly more accessible. Most of the changes are projected to take place in the central area of the town.

The northern part of the city's central area will witness the demolishing of the row of shops and the transformation of the countryside, which is situated to the north of them. The shopping lane and its northern adjacent area are set to see the construction of a bus station, a shopping center and a car park in the order from west to east. Furthermore, the easternmost part will be replaced by new housing which is connected with a small road to a dual carriageway. 
The dual carriageway is planned to entirely encircle the town center, while the original main road to the south of these shops is projected to be removed and substituted with a pedestrian-only street. Adjacent to the southern side of the main road, the other lane of shops will be expanded by one third.    


Due to the shops' expansion as well as the laying of the dual carriageway, the houses on the southern part's border will be demolished, and those in the southeast will be reconstructed, with the park in this section reduced in size by one third. In addition to the striking transformation within the town center, the school to its southwest is set to expand roughly by one fourth to connect to the dual carriageway, whereas the houses to its southern side will remain unchanged.
