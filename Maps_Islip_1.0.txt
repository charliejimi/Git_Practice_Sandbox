The maps illustrate Islip’s current layout and its development plan.

With the plan for the city’s new layout, the transition makes it more commercial and residential, and its transportation routes will become much more accessible. Most of the changes are projected to take place in the central feature of the town.

In the current layout, there is countryside and shops north of the main road.  In the new development plan, the western half of these areas will be replaced by bus stations, a shopping center and a car park. With respect to the eastern section of this area, the shops will be demolished and replaced by new houses, (which will extend into the eastern part of the countryside.??) 

Turning to the southern section of the main road, the park situated in the southeastern area will be reduced in size and new houses will be constructed directly to the south. Apart from this, a dual carriageway will be developed and fully encircle the town. Although these parts of the south area will undergo major changes, the school and houses located on the southern edge of the town center, the houses to the southeast of the main road, and the shops adjacent to its southern side will remain unchanged.
