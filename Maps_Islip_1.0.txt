The maps illustrate Islipâ€™s current layout and its development plan.

Overall, the plan makes the city more commercial and residential, and its transportation routes will become significantly more accessible. Most of the changes are projected to take place in the central area of the town.

The northern part of the city's central area will witness the demolishing of the row of shops and thereafter the construction of a bus station, a shopping center and a car park in order of position from west to east. In the current layout, there is countryside and shops north of the main road.  In the new development plan, the western half of these areas will be replaced by bus stations, a shopping center and a car park. With respect to the eastern section of this area, the shops will be demolished and replaced by new houses, (which will extend into the eastern part of the countryside.??) 

Turning to the southern section of the main road, the park situated in the southeastern area will be reduced in size and new houses will be constructed directly to the south. Apart from this, a dual carriageway will be developed and fully encircle the town. Although these parts of the south area will undergo major changes, the school and houses located on the southern edge of the town center, the houses to the southeast of the main road, and the shops adjacent to its southern side will remain unchanged.
